# Problem Set 4 — Model Selection, Classification, and the Curse of Dimensionality

This folder contains all deliverables for Problem Set 4.

---

## Topics Covered

**Part I**: Model selection and regularization  
- Bias-variance tradeoff analysis for Lasso, Ridge, and non-linear models  
- Training vs. test MSE comparison using best subset selection  
- Coefficient accuracy assessment and overfitting detection  
- Regularization with Lasso and Ridge  
- Principal Component Regression (PCR)  
- Model comparison for predicting crime rates in Boston

**Part II**: Classification and the curse of dimensionality  
- Effect of dimensionality on KNN prediction accuracy  
- Error rate interpretation in 1-NN vs. logistic regression  
- Quadratic discriminant analysis using multivariate Gaussian assumptions  
- Equivalence between logistic regression and softmax  
- Classification methods (Logistic, LDA, QDA, KNN, Naive Bayes) applied to `Weekly` dataset  
- Model tuning, training/testing splits, and accuracy comparison
