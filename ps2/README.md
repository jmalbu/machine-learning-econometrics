# Problem Set 2

This folder contains all deliverables for Problem Set 2.

---

## Topics Covered

**Part I**: Conceptual and theoretical exercises from *An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL)*, Chapter 3  
- Interpretation of p-values in multiple linear regression (TV, radio, newspaper advertising and sales)  
- Reasoning through interaction effects in salary prediction models (GPA × IQ, GPA × education level)  
- Prediction and interpretation of coefficients in multivariate models  
- Bias-variance tradeoff and model flexibility  
- Training vs. test error behavior in linear vs. polynomial regression  
- Overfitting, underfitting, and the implications of sample size on model complexity   

**Part II**: Applied linear regression modeling using the *Auto* and *Boston* datasets  
- Simple and multiple linear regression  
- Model interpretation and statistical inference  
- Diagnostic plots and model assumptions  
- Interaction terms and multicollinearity  
- Variable transformations (log, square root, quadratic)  
- Univariate vs. multivariate regression comparison  
- Detection of non-linear relationships with polynomial terms  

**Part III**: Modeling home prices and buyer behavior using the *Homes 2004* dataset  
- Visualized relationships between income, buyer status, and log home prices  
- Interpreted full vs. reduced multiple regression models for log home price  
- Identified statistically significant predictors and compared model performance (Adjusted R²)  
- Built logistic regression models to predict likelihood of ≥20% down payments  
- Assessed effect of first-time buyer status, bathrooms, and their interaction  
- Evaluated logistic model performance on high-value vs. low-value home subsets

## Tools Used

- `R` – primary programming language  
- `ggplot2` – for data visualization  
- `dplyr` – for data manipulation and wrangling  
- `readr` – for reading CSV and tabular data  
- `broom` – for tidying model output into data frames  
- `ggthemes` – for applying professional and publication-ready plot themes  
- `patchwork` – for combining multiple `ggplot2` plots into a single layout  
- `tidyverse` – for streamlined, cohesive data analysis workflows
