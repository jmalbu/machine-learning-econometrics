# ECON 573 ‚Äì Statistical Learning (Spring 2025)

This repository contains all problem sets completed as part of ECON 573: Statistical Learning and Data Science, an advanced undergraduate economics course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The course is based on the textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) and focuses on applying statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world data using R. The assignments are divided into conceptual exercises, applied programming problems, and model evaluation projects.

Each problem set explores different statistical learning techniques using R, including linear models, classification, resampling methods, model selection, regularization, tree-based methods, PCA, clustering, and more.
