This repository contains all problem sets completed as part of ECON 573: Machine Learning and Econometrics, an advanced undergraduate economics course at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

> This repository documents my work and progress in ECON 573, reflecting my ability to apply machine learning techniques to real-world economic data using R.

The course is based on the textbook An Introduction to Statistical Learning (ISL) and focuses on applying statistical and machine learning techniques to real-world data using R. The assignments are divided into conceptual exercises, applied programming problems, and model evaluation projects.

Each problem set explores different statistical learning techniques using R, including linear models, classification, resampling methods, model selection, regularization, tree-based methods, PCA, clustering, and more.

## Topics & Techniques Covered

Linear & Logistic Regression, Classification (LDA, QDA, KNN, Naive Bayes), Cross-Validation, Model Selection, Ridge & LASSO Regularization, Bootstrapping, Polynomial & Spline Regression, Boosting, PCA, Clustering

## Repository Structure

Each folder corresponds to a problem set and includes:

- Instructions (PDF, if provided)  
- RMarkdown file with code and explanations (`.Rmd`)  
- Output files (`.pdf` or `.html`)  
- A custom README describing tools, methods, and results
